The auditor has to evaluate whether the documentation meets the referenced requirements of the ISO standard. This does not require a full certification audit of the management system in accordance with ISO 17021, but a focused inspection of the related documentation.<br><br>Cross-sectional functions do not need to be integrated into a single ISMS. Instead, multiple ISMS can be established to cover both service-related internal control systems and central functions effectively.<br><br>The scope of the ISMS may go beyond the scope of the cloud service provider's system of internal control for the cloud service in scope of an assurance engagement with this criteria catalogue. If the scope of the ISMS is broader than the scope of the assurance engagement, evidence to be obtained about the design and operation of the ISMS can be limited to records that are applicable to the cloud service in scope of the assurance engagement.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | \--                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

Very extensive events which, due to their extent, could affect several sites of the same redundancy group simultaneously or in a timely manner (e.g. floods, earthquakes) are not considered.<br><br>There are cloud service providers who no longer address the issue of reliability of the cloud service on a physical level through redundancy from two independent locations, but through resilience. The cloud service is provided simultaneously from more than two locations. The underlying distributed data centre architecture ensures that the failure of a location or components of a location does not violate the defined availability criteria of the cloud service. Such an architecture can represent an alternative fulfilment (cf. Chapter 3.4.8) of the criterion. The tests and exercises on functionality required in the criterion also apply analogously to resilient architectures.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Cloud service customers ensure through suitable controls that the existing redundancy model of the cloud service provider and the evidence for the verification of the model comply with their own requirements for the availability and reliability of the cloud service.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

The tests and exercises on functionality required in the criterion also apply analogously to resilient architectures.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

They are in accordance with the cloud service provider's security requirements (cf. PS-01) and based on the principles defined in IAM-01 to prevent unauthorised access. They are documented and communicated in a policy or concept in accordance with SP-01 and include the following aspects:<br><br>\- Specified procedure for the granting and revoking of access authorisations (cf. IAM-02) based on the principle of least authorisation ('least-privilege-principle') and as necessary for the performance of tasks ('need-to-know-principle');<br>\- Revocation of access authorisations if they have not been used for a period of 2 months. Exceptions are only made for well-founded individual cases and follow a defined exception process according to SP-03;<br>\- Authentication with at least one factor for access to any non-public area;<br>\- Two-factor authentication for access to areas hosting system components that process cloud service customer data;<br>\- Visitors and external personnel are tracked individually by the access control during their work in the premises and buildings, identified as such (e.g. by visible wearing of a visitor pass) and supervised during their stay by employees who authorise or deny their actions, and question them if needed about their actions;<br>\- Existence and nature of access logging that enables the cloud service provider, in the sense of an effectiveness audit, to check whether only defined personnel have entered the premises and buildings related to the cloud service provided;<br>\- Physical access control derogations in case of emergency, including an analysis procedure after every use of these derogations; and<br>\- Measures to identify individuals who are not part of the personnel, incorporating them into the access policy system and defining the conditions, if any, under which they may be granted access to the premises.<br> | For implementing access control based on the need-to-know-principle, a zoning concept can be deployed with each on-premises area having separate access permissions. If a zoning concept is implemented, each on-premises area should be physically separated with its own access control system. Examples for zoning on-premises can be:<br><br>\- Green zone: Public area, contains no resources that are relevant to the provisioning of the cloud service;<br>\- Yellow zone: Private area, contains means for supporting the cloud service such as development, administration and supervision; and<br>\- Red zone: Sensitive area for production systems such as the server rooms.<br><br>Exceptions to the revocation of access authorisations after two months of inactivity are limited to cases where employees with specific roles, such as management positions or supervisors, require only occasional but crucial entry. For all other employees, the revocation of access rights takes place after two months as described in the criterion.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | \--                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

If the procedures are not documented or are subject to a higher degree of confidentiality as a trade secret of the cloud service provider, the cloud service provider should be able to explain the procedures at least orally within the scope of this audit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

The extent to which the criterion is applicable to the cloud service is presented in the system description.<br>The data backup concept specifies which type of data backup is to be carried out (e.g. scope, frequency and duration) and specifies which data shall also be backed up in special cases (e.g. pure use of compute nodes without data storage). When backing up data, one has to distinct between \*backups\* and \*snapshots\* of virtual machines. Snapshots do not replace backups but can be part of the backup strategy to achieve Recovery Point Objectives (RPO) if they are additionally stored outside the original data location. The business requirements of the cloud service provider for the scope, frequency and duration of the data backup result from the business impact analysis (cf. BCM-02) for development and operational processes of the cloud service. If different data backup and recovery procedures exist for cloud service customer data and cloud service provider data, both variants should be in scope for tests of controls according to this criteria catalogue.<br><br>Existing contractual agreements prior to a C5 attestation do not need to be updated to incorporate the requirements specified in this criterion. Instead, new contractual agreements should be designed to ensure that specified requirements are clearly defined and agreed upon with cloud service customers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Cloud service customers ensure through suitable controls that the contractual agreements made with the cloud service provider regarding the scope, frequency and duration of data retention meet business requirements.

cloud service, including purposes related to the implementation of security controls;<br>\- Protection in confidentiality and integrity of the logs;<br>\- As far as technically possible, anonymised cloud service derived data is used only in a way so that no conclusions can be drawn about the usage behaviour of individual users of the cloud service customer;<br>\- No commercial use beyond the aforementioned purpose to administer and operate the cloud service;<br>\- Storage for a fixed period reasonably related to the purposes of the collection;<br>\- Cloud service derived data that has been fully anonymised and cannot be traced back to individual cloud service customers may be further processed and retained, provided no contractual or legal restrictions exist, otherwise immediate deletion if the purposes of the collection are fulfilled and further storage is no longer necessary; and<br>\- Provision to cloud service customers according to contractual agreements.<br>

OIS-07), the cloud service provider established guidelines and instructions with technical and organisational measures to ensure separation of cloud service customer data between different customers and between customers and the cloud service provider. These guidelines and instructions are documented, communicated and provided in accordance with SP-01 and contain specifications regarding the client separation based on a documented cloud layer model (cf. OPS-29) and include the following:<br><br>\- Illustration of which cloud layers are used for the particular cloud service. The used cloud layers should be appropriate to enable client separation;<br>\- Measures used to separate cloud service customer data along the used cloud layers. Those measures are categorised according to the protection goals of confidentiality, integrity and availability and if they are preventive, detective or reactive measures;<br>\- Monitoring and compliance with these measures; and<br>\- Initiation of suitable measures in the event of deviations.<br>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | The guidelines and instructions of this criteria are meant to serve as an umbrella guideline for all cyber security measures against all threats that stem from sharing physical or virtual ressources and that lead to a loss of separation of data sets. Ideally, the cloud service provider has already ensured the separation of data sets between different customers and between customers and cloud service provider via all other guidelines, instructions and the corresponding measures. The systematic approach of the guidelines and instructions addressed by this criterion ensures that no aspect of this separation is overlooked. It also provides a good basis to explain the cyber security of the cloud service to the customer in an appealing manner (cf. PSS-01).<br><br>Cloud layers in the sense of this criterion can be found in the \*CISA Cloud Security Technical Reverence Architecture\*. The cloud service provider may use its own categorisation of cloud layers.<br><br>There are nine combinations for confidentiality, integrity and availability with prevention, detection and reaction. Applying this to every cloud layer may lead to a large number of combinations. However, depending on the cloud service, it can be acceptable that it may not be possible to provide meaningful information in the guideline for every possible combination of prevention, detection and reaction as well as confidentiality, integrity and availability. Those cases should be comprehensibly documented in the guidelines and instructions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | \--                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

The separation of cloud service customer data on shared resources can take place, for example, in accordance with cloud layers described in the CISA Cloud Security TRA. Where the adequacy and effectiveness of segregation cannot be assessed with reasonable assurance (e.g. due to complex implementation), evidence may also be provided through expert third party review results (e.g. penetration tests to validate the concept).

Only authorised entities are allowed to introduce or modify applications or code within the TEE. The attestation of the TEE and the application running within the TEE serves to validate the trustworthiness of the processing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | \--                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

AM-02, AM-03, AM-09);<br>\- The need for malware protection is assessed and, if necessary, ensured (cf. OPS-05);<br>\- Logging and monitoring of events takes place along the container lifecycle and is executed according to a defined logging concept (cf. OPS-10, OPS-12);<br>\- Cloud service customer data is separated based on a risk analysis (cf. OPS-29);<br>\- Access to the container host should take place in accordance with a roles and rights concept and a policy for managing access and access authorisations (cf. IAM-01, IAM-06);<br>\- Data stored on containers and data in transit should be encrypted as far as possible by the provider in accordance with the encryption policy (cf. CRY-01);<br>\- Measures to ensure network security are established. This includes, for example, measures to detect network anomalies (cf.

In order to build trust into such access statements, the cloud service provider should describe in the system description the taken measures to enlarge the collusion circle.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

In order to build trust into such access statements, the cloud service provider should describe in the system description the taken measures to enlarge the collusion circle.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

Generally, the use of wildcard certificates is not considered a secure procedure.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

These procedures ensure that:<br><br>\- Expired keys are no longer used for encryption purposes, but may still be used for decryption if necessary;<br>\- Expired keys are no longer used for signature creation, but may still be used for signature verification;<br>\- Deactivated keys are eventually destroyed when they are no longer required, with relevant metadata retained for auditing; and<br>\- All actions related to key deactivation and destruction are recorded in the key management system to maintain a detailed audit log.<br>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | \--                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | \--                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

The backup process should ensure that the keys are encrypted during storage and transit to prevent unauthorised access. Regular testing of backup and recovery procedures should be carried out to verify the effectiveness and integrity of the backups. Backups outside a HSM should only be considered after dilligent risk analysis.<br><br>\- Redundant HSMs: Implementing multiple HSMs in geographically dispersed locations to create redundancy to ensure that keys remain available and secure even if one HSM fails. The HSMs should be synchronised to ensure consistency of key material across all devices.

The backup process should ensure that the keys are encrypted during storage and transit to prevent unauthorised access. Regular testing of backup and recovery procedures should be carried out to verify the effectiveness and integrity of the backups. Backups outside a HSM should only be considered after dilligent risk analysis.<br><br>\- Redundant HSMs: Implementing multiple HSMs in geographically dispersed locations to create redundancy to ensure that keys remain available and secure even if one HSM fails. The HSMs should be synchronised to ensure consistency of key material across all devices. Regular health checks and failover tests are necessary to ensure that redundancy mechanisms function correctly. The particular manner this redundancy is built may depend on the details of the contractual agreements between provider and customer. E.g. when the customer choose a particular location, zone or region, this choice also applies to the redundancy mentioned in this criterion.<br>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

It comprises documented methods that allow cloud service customers to securely access and interact with the cloud service, enabling the exchange of data.<br><br>While these interfaces provide the means for communication with the cloud service, they do not imply that cloud service customers can directly connect their custom systems as if they are natively integrated. Instead, cloud service customers can configure their systems by using methods, such as API calls, and adhering to the specified protocols and data formats provided by the cloud service provider.<br><br>To ensure seamless and secure communication between interfaces, the cloud service provider uses industry-standard API protocols and implements state-of-the-art transport layer security. The cloud service provider supports cross-platform information processing by employing containerisation technologies and cloud-neutral development frameworks. Infrastructre as Code practices are adopted to standardise infrastructre provisioning. Common data usage policies are defined and enforced to ensure consistent and secure access, utilisation and sharing of data.

the contract and definition of the timeframe, within which the cloud service provider makes the cloud service customer data available to the cloud service customer after termination of the contract;<br>\- Definition of the point in time as of which the cloud service provider makes the cloud service customer data inaccessible to the cloud service customer and deletes these after termination of the contract;<br>\- The cloud service customers' responsibilities and obligations to cooperate for the provision of the cloud service customer data; and<br>\- Cloud service customer data remains the property of the cloud service customer throughout the entire contractual relationship. After its termination, the data is once again the sole property and possession of the cloud service customer.<br><br>The definitions are based on the needs of subject matter experts of potential customers who assess the suitability of the cloud service with regard to a dependency on the cloud service provider as well as legal and regulatory requirements.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | The type and scope of the data and the responsibilities for its provision depend on the service model of the cloud service or the services and functions provided:<br><br>In the case of IaaS- and PaaS-like services, the cloud service customer is generally responsible for extracting and backing up the data which is stored in the cloud service before termination of the contractual relationship (cf. complementary requirement).<br><br>The cloud service provider's responsibility is typically limited to the provision of data for the configuration of the infrastructure or platform that the cloud service customer has set up within its environment (e.g. configuration of networks, images of virtual machines and containers).<br><br>With SaaS, the cloud service customer typically relies on export functions provided by the cloud service provider. Data created by the cloud service customer should be available in the same format as stored in the cloud service.

and verification) including the existence of a security by design principle, enforcing the consideration of information security requirements in the software development phase;<br>\- Security and quality in software deployment (including continuous delivery);<br>\- Security and quality in operation (reaction to identified faults and vulnerabilities); and<br>\- Secure coding standards and practices (reducing the introduction of vulnerabilities in code).

methods.<br><br>Accepted standards and methods for secure development are, for example:<br><br>\- ISO/IEC 27034; and<br>\- OWASP Secure Software Development Lifecycle (S-SDLC).<br>Minimisation of customer data access during operation can be supported by following robust security models, such as Zero Trust, during cloud architecture development. Furthermore, aspects such as limiting data interfaces, API calls and access as well as ensuring end-to-end-encryption from transit to storage are relevant considerations.<br><br>For quality assurance in software development, the following can be considered to be relevant processes:<br><br>\- Planning and definition of quality objectives: Definition of quality requirements based on customer needs and objectives, taking into account the requirements of the cloud system to be developed.<br>\- Design phase: Carrying out design reviews and inspections of the cloud service to ensure that the design meets the quality requirements.<br>\- Development phase: Use of code reviews and pair programming to ensure code quality. Use of static analysis tools to check the code for potential errors and violations of coding standards.<br>\- Testing phase: Execution (automated where possible) of various types of tests (e.g. unit tests, integration tests, system tests, acceptance tests) to ensure the functionality and quality of the software.<br>\- Integration and continuous integration (CI): Integration of the various software components and continuous checking of the integrations through automated builds and tests. Use of CI/CD pipelines to ensure that the code is regularly integrated and tested.<br>\- Release and deployment: Preparation and implementation of the software release in accordance with defined quality standards.<br>\- Maintenance and continuous improvement: Monitoring the software in operation to ensure that it continues to meet the quality requirements. This includes post release activities such as bug fixing and performance optimisation processes.

Furthermore, aspects such as limiting data interfaces, API calls and access as well as ensuring end-to-end-encryption from transit to storage are relevant considerations.<br><br>For quality assurance in software development, the following can be considered to be relevant processes:<br><br>\- Planning and definition of quality objectives: Definition of quality requirements based on customer needs and objectives, taking into account the requirements of the cloud system to be developed.<br>\- Design phase: Carrying out design reviews and inspections of the cloud service to ensure that the design meets the quality requirements.<br>\- Development phase: Use of code reviews and pair programming to ensure code quality. Use of static analysis tools to check the code for potential errors and violations of coding standards.<br>\- Testing phase: Execution (automated where possible) of various types of tests (e.g. unit tests, integration tests, system tests, acceptance tests) to ensure the functionality and quality of the software.<br>\- Integration and continuous integration (CI): Integration of the various software components and continuous checking of the integrations through automated builds and tests. Use of CI/CD pipelines to ensure that the code is regularly integrated and tested.<br>\- Release and deployment: Preparation and implementation of the software release in accordance with defined quality standards.<br>\- Maintenance and continuous improvement: Monitoring the software in operation to ensure that it continues to meet the quality requirements. This includes post release activities such as bug fixing and performance optimisation processes. Additionally, post-mortem analyses should be performed to learn from incidents and optimise processes for future releases.<br><br>An accepted standard and a method for quality in development processes is, for example, Google Site Reliability Engineering (SRE).<br><br>The scope of the DEV criteria and the requirements within includes not only the development of software applications but also platforms, virtual infrastructure, and other system components. |

IAM-01) via a specified procedure (cf. IAM-02). Relevant information includes descriptions of e.g. new functions.<br><br>The cloud service customer's obligations to cooperate can define that, e.g. the cloud service customer has to carry out certain tests.<br><br>A centralised change management process is not mandatory.

transmission and access control for data shared with third parties;<br>\- It is identified whether third parties used by the cloud service provider itself rely on service providers that contribute to the provisioning of the cloud service;<br>\- If third parties rely on service providers, the types of data processed by the service providers are identified and risks related to the subcontracting of services are assessed (cf. SSO-02).<br>\- If third parties rely on service providers, require the third parties to monitor the compliance of their service providers with relevant contractual, legal and regulatory requirements (cf.

Audits may be performed as internal audits, sometimes called first party audits, that are conducted by, or on behalf of, the organisation itself. They may also be performed as external audits, generally called second and third party audits. Second party audits are conducted by parties having an interest in the organisation, such as customers, or by other individuals on their behalf. Third party audits are conducted by independent auditing organisations.<br><br>An audit programme comprises arrangements for a set of one or more audits planned for a specific time frame and directed towards a specific purpose.

When establishing the internal audit program(s), the cloud service provider should define the scope and criteria by considering the importance of the processes concerned and the results of previous audits. This approach allows cloud service providers to define the audit scope based on the criticality of complying with relevant legal, regulatory, or contractual requirements (cf. COM-01) and internal policies and instructions (cf. SP-01), without requiring a comprehensive review of all requirements during each audit cycle.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | \--                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

Guidance on the complementary customer controls helps cloud service customers understand their roles and responsibilities within the Shared Responsibility Model, also in terms of security and operational management (cf. OIS-03). By offering detailed guidance, cloud service customers are equipped to understand and implement the necessary controls that fall under their responsibility. The level of detail and length can vary according to the type of cloud service provided.<br><br>Examples for defensive mechanisms include payload filtering, traffic shaping, load balancing, load shedding and DDoS defences.<br><br>Examples for wide-area distributed architecture mechanisms include replication for fault tolerance, multiple cloud regions to avoid localised outages and disasters and geo-dispersion of service endpoints to reduce user-facing latency.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Cloud service customers ensure through suitable controls that the cloud service provider's information is used to derive policies, concepts and measures for the secure configuration and use (according to their own risk assessment) of the cloud service.
